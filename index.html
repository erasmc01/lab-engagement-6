        <h1>New 'super-Earth' Discovery</h1>
        <p>The new 'super-Earth' or <a
                href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/exoplanets/discovery-alert-a-super-earth-in-the-habitable-zone/">TOI-715
                b</a> is comparable to that of our own Earth for countless reasons hence receiving its same. Below is
            listed
            the features that make it the new 'super-Earth'.</p>

            <h2>Habitability</h2>
            <p>Planet TOI-715 b nicknamed the new 'super-Earth' is closely identical to our own Earth as it is
                potentially
                habitable. Planet TOI-715 b is positioned in the 'conservative' habitable zone of its parent star; a
                zone in
                which temperatures allow liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>

            <p>What are its possibilities of being habitable?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Obtains an atmosphere</li>
                <li>Considered as a “water world”</li>
                <li>Sits right in the region of its star where its not too hot or too cold</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Size and More</h2>
            <p>The exoplanet, TOI-715 b is about 1 ½ times wider than our Earth! Because of its layout it received its
                name as
                'super-Earth' indicating a larger size. Despite its size, this newly discovered plant only takes 19 days
                to
                orbit its parent star while it takes a considerable 365 days for Earth to orbit the Sun.</p>
